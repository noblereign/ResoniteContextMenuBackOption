# ContextMenuBackOption

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that adds a back button to every context menu submenu.

By default, this only affects "player-made" submenus (i.e. avatar/system submenus), but you can enable it to work on default Resonite submenus as well. (like the Locomotion submenu)

If a submenu has an existing back button, it will be prioritized compared to the one from this mod.

There's also an alternate design in the mod settings to place the back button below the inner circle, saving space.

2. Place [ContextMenuBackOption.dll](https://github.com/noblereign/ResoniteContextMenuBackOption/releases/latest/download/ContextMenuBackOption.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create this folder for you.
